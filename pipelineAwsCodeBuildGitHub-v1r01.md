Please being aws professional architect. Show the all detail steps to implement the descrition below: I would like to create a CI/CD pipeline with the use of github, aws code build, aws elastic beanstalk. The environment I use is ubuntu 20 and python 3.7. I like to use eb create cli to deploy a hello world Flask application to aws elastic beanstalk. Steps are as below: 1. install pyenv 2. use pyenv to install python3.7 3. install awscli 4. configure it with your AWS credentials and default settings using awscli 5. use python venv to create a "hello world" Flask Application 6. Deploy the Flask Application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk 7. Push Code to GitHub 8. Set up Continuous Delivery with AWS CodeBuild a. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to AWS CodeBuild and create a new build project. b. Connect it with your GitHub repository. c. Configure a buildspec file or use the AWS CodeBuild console to define build commands to test and package your application. d. Use the AWS CodePipeline service to set up a continuous delivery pipeline. Link your source repository (GitHub) to the build stage (AWS CodeBuild) and then to a deploy stage targeting AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Great! Let's break it down step by step. For the sake of clarity, I will also include some command line examples where applicable.

### 1\. Install pyenv:

bashCopy code

`# First, install prerequisites for pyenv
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python3-openssl git

# Then, install pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash` 

Add pyenv to the shell `$PATH` by adding the following to `~/.bashrc`:

bashCopy code

`export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"` 

Restart your shell.

### 2\. Use pyenv to install python3.7:

bashCopy code

`pyenv install 3.7.12
pyenv global 3.7.12` 

### 3\. Install awscli:

bashCopy code

`pip install awscli` 

### 4\. Configure AWS CLI:

bashCopy code

`aws configure` 

You'll be prompted to provide your AWS access key ID, secret access key, region, and desired output format.

### 5\. Create "Hello World" Flask Application:

First, install `virtualenv`:

bashCopy code

`pip install virtualenv` 

Now, create a new virtual environment and activate it:

bashCopy code

`python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate` 

Install Flask:

bashCopy code

`pip install Flask` 

Write a simple Flask application named `app.py`:

pythonCopy code

```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
``` 

Save your dependencies:

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

### 6\. Deploy the Flask Application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

1.  Install the EB CLI:

bashCopy code

`pip install awsebcli` 

2.  Initialize your Elastic Beanstalk environment:

bashCopy code

`eb init -p python-3.7 my-flask-app` 

3.  Create your environment:

bashCopy code

`eb create my-flask-env` 

The application should be accessible via a URL provided by Elastic Beanstalk.

### 7\. Push Code to GitHub:

First, ensure you have git installed:

bashCopy code

`sudo apt install git` 

Initialize git in your project directory and push it to GitHub:

bashCopy code

`git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-github-repository-url>
git push -u origin master` 

### 8\. Set up Continuous Delivery with AWS CodeBuild:

#### a. In AWS Management Console, navigate to AWS CodeBuild and create a new build project.

#### b. Connect it with your GitHub repository.

Choose "GitHub" as the source provider. You'll be prompted to connect your AWS account to GitHub.

#### c. Configure a `buildspec.yml` file:

Create a `buildspec.yml` in the root directory of your repository. A simple example for this project might look like:

ymlCopy code

`version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      python: 3.7
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies...
      - pip install -r requirements.txt
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed.` 

#### d. Use AWS CodePipeline:

1.  Navigate to the AWS CodePipeline console and create a new pipeline.
2.  Connect your GitHub repository as the source stage.
3.  For the build stage, select the AWS CodeBuild project you set up earlier.
4.  For the deployment stage, select AWS Elastic Beanstalk and choose the application and environment you set up.

Save and run your pipeline. With each push to your GitHub repository, your pipeline should now automatically build your Flask app and deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk.
