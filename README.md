Sure, the following steps cover your requirements: creating an AWS CodeBuild project with a GitHub repository as the source, saving logs and outputs to an S3 bucket, using a VPC endpoint to access the S3 bucket, and using an IAM role for S3 access.

Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

1.  Navigate to the AWS S3 console, click "Create bucket".
    
2.  Name your bucket and select the region you desire.
    
3.  Leave the rest as default or configure as you desire, then click "Create".
    

Step 2: Create a VPC Endpoint for S3

1.  Go to the VPC dashboard and click "Endpoints" on the left.
    
2.  Click "Create Endpoint".
    
3.  In the "Service category" section, select "AWS services".
    
4.  For the "Service Name", select "com.amazonaws.\[region\].s3" for your region.
    
5.  In the "VPC" dropdown, select the VPC you want the endpoint to reside in.
    
6.  You can leave the "Configure route tables" and "Security group" as default, then click "Create endpoint".
    

Step 3: Create an IAM Role for CodeBuild

1.  Navigate to the IAM console, click "Roles" on the left, then click "Create role".
    
2.  Select "AWS service" as the trusted entity type, then select "CodeBuild".
    
3.  Click "Next: Permissions". In the policy list, find and select "AmazonS3FullAccess", which gives CodeBuild the permission to access S3.
    
4.  Click "Next: Tags" then "Next: Review". Name your role, give it a description if you want, then click "Create role".
    

Step 4: Create a CodeBuild Project

1.  Navigate to the CodeBuild console and click "Create build project".
    
2.  Name your project.
    
3.  For "Source", choose "GitHub", then connect to your GitHub account and choose your repository.
    
4.  For "Environment", choose "Managed image", select the operating system, runtime, image, and environment type you desire.
    
5.  For the "Service role", choose the role you created in Step 3.
    
6.  In the "Additional configuration" section, select the VPC, subnets, and security groups that include the VPC endpoint you created in Step 2.
    
7.  For "Buildspec", choose "Use a buildspec file" if you have one in your repository, otherwise, you can choose "Insert build commands" to provide the build commands manually.
    
8.  For "Artifacts", choose "Amazon S3", select the bucket you created in Step 1 as the "Bucket name", and name your output artifact if you have one.
    
9.  For "Logs", choose "CloudWatch Logs" and "S3 Logs", then choose the bucket you created in Step 1 as the "S3 bucket name".
    
10.  Click "Create build project".
    

Now you have created an AWS CodeBuild project linked to a GitHub repository, and it's configured to save the logs and outputs to an S3 bucket using a VPC endpoint for access. The CodeBuild project uses the IAM role you created for S3 bucket access.# PracticalMLOpsNoahChapter1-01
